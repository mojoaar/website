      <description>Introduction If you are sharing passwords or other sensitive data over IM, email etc. you should take a look at this free web application. The application is called cryptgeon and is developed by a guy called Nicco. The application will only keep the shared secrets/files in memory and not write the data to disk. You can have a look at his GitHub repo here or see the screenshot below for the UI.</description>
